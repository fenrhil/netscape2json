Use the "netscape2json" script in order to convert your HTML bookmarks file to a Firefox-compatible JSON file.

Please note that the only tested case was a single (but big) file exported from http://www.delicious.com/ (with tags, without notes). It seems to have worked pretty well, but it probably won't work for any HTML bookmarks file. Good luck ;)
